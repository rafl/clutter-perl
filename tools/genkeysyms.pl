=head1 NAME

Clutter::Keysyms - key codes for Clutter programs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Clutter;
 use Clutter::Keysyms;

 #
 # the most common use is for deciphering keycodes in key events,
 # like this:
 #
 sub key_press_handler {
         my ($widget, $event) = @_;
         if ($event->keyval == $Clutter::Keysyms{Escape}) {
                 abort_whatever ();
                 return 1;
         elsif ($event->keyval == $Clutter::Keysyms{F1}) {
                 do_help_thing ();
                 return 1;
         elsif ($event->keyval == $Clutter::Keysyms{KP_Enter}) {
                 execute_selected_text_as_command ();
                 return 1;
         }
         # we didn't handle it, pass it on...
	 return 0;
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Clutter defines symbolic names for the codes associated with each key on a
keyboard, so that you don't go nuts with numeric values in your programs.
The hash C<%Clutter::Keysyms> holds all those keycodes, indexed by the
name, for use in your perl programs when you need to do custom key handling.
This commonly occurs when you want to bind an action to a key that isn't 
usable as an accelerator, or when you don't have accelerators, or if you're
trying to write an easter egg, or whatever.

As the list of keycodes is quite large and rather rarely used in application
code, we've put it in a separately-loaded module to save space.

To get a list of all available keys, either dump C<%Clutter::Keysyms>, or
look at the source of this module with C<perldoc -m Clutter::Keysyms>.

=head1 AUTHOR

This module was automatically generated by a very simple perl script
from gdk/gdkkeysyms.h.  Programs that write programs are the happiest
programs of all.
